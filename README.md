# Rod Ltd Sales Performance Analysis (KPI Dashboard)

## Project Overview
Rod Ltd is a mid-sized retail and wholesale company operating across multiple regions in the United States.  
Between 2014 and 2018, company leadership observed **uneven regional growth, slowing sales momentum, and heavy dependence on specific channels**, but lacked a consolidated, data-driven view to support strategic decisions.

This project simulates a **real-world internal sales analytics initiative**, where historical sales data was analyzed to evaluate performance trends, identify growth gaps, and recommend actions to improve revenue and market penetration.

> **Note:** Rod Ltd is a fictional company used strictly for analytical and portfolio purposes.

## Business Problem
Despite consistent revenue generation, Rod Ltd faced several operational challenges:
- Sales growth began to **slow by 2018**
- Revenue was **concentrated in a few regions and channels**
- High-potential markets were **underperforming**
- Leadership lacked a **central KPI dashboard** for monitoring sales performance

Without actionable insights, sales and expansion decisions were largely reactive rather than strategic.

## Business Objectives
The objective of this analysis was to:
1. Evaluate overall sales performance between **2014–2018**
2. Identify **regional and channel-level performance gaps**
3. Analyze product-level contribution to revenue
4. Detect early warning signs of **growth slowdown**
5. Build an interactive KPI dashboard to support management decisions

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **Microsoft Excel**
- **Power Query** for data cleaning and transformation
- **Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts**
- **Excel KPI Dashboard**

---

## Dataset Description

   - Evaluated sales performance by region, state, and channel

3. **Product & Customer Analysis**
   - Identified top-performing SKUs
   - Analyzed repeat customer behavior

4. **Dashboard Development**
   - Built an interactive Excel KPI dashboard for executive-level reporting

## Key Insights

### 1. Geographic Sales Concentration
Sales revenue was heavily concentrated in **California, Illinois, Texas, and Florida**, indicating reliance on a limited number of high-performing states.

---

### 2. Channel Dependence
The **Wholesale channel** consistently generated the highest share of revenue, making it the company’s primary growth driver but also a potential risk if over-relied upon.

---

### 3. Northeast Market Under-Penetration
Despite strong market potential, the **Northeast region (especially New York)** underperformed compared to other regions, signaling missed expansion opportunities.

---

### 4. Product Demand Signals in the Northeast
Products **7, 2, 6, and 4** performed well in the Northeast, suggesting existing demand that could be scaled with targeted sales efforts.

---

### 5. Sales Growth Slowdown in 2018
Overall sales growth stagnated in 2018, driven by a **decline in units sold**, indicating volume-related challenges rather than pricing issues.

---

### 6. Customer Retention Opportunity
Repeat customer patterns were observed, highlighting an opportunity to introduce **loyalty and retention programs** to increase lifetime value.

---

## Business Recommendations

1. **Expand Northeast Market Presence**
   - Increase targeted sales and marketing efforts in New York and surrounding states
   - Leverage high-performing SKUs to accelerate regional adoption

2. **Reduce Channel Risk**
   - Strengthen wholesale partnerships while gradually expanding other sales channels

3. **Address Volume Decline**
   - Investigate causes of declining unit sales (pricing, competition, inventory, demand shifts)
   - Introduce promotions or bundled offers to stimulate volume growth

4. **Improve Customer Retention**
   - Implement loyalty and referral programs to capitalize on repeat customer behavior

5. **Executive Monitoring**
   - Use the KPI dashboard for ongoing performance tracking and strategic planning

---

## Business Impact
If implemented, these recommendations would help Rod Ltd:
- Restore sales growth momentum
- Improve regional market penetration
- Reduce dependency on a single channel
- Increase customer lifetime value
- Enable data-driven decision-making at the executive level
